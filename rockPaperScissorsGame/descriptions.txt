engulfing you, so you can bearly breethe
--blades-------------------

slicing your throat
piercing your lungs, and leaving you to die slowly, unable to breethe
decapitating you, in one quick swipe through the air
carving lines deep into your skin, then leaving you alone in a pool of blood
--guns-------------------
hammering rounds upon rounds into your skull
piercing your heart with one precise shot
tearing a burst of bullets through your limp body
slamming two destructive shots into your stomach, causing your stomach acid to leak out and infect your living flesh

detonating it right by your feet, sending a tremendous shockwave through your body
exploding and tearing your body into shreds
causing your body to be torn apart in all directions

throwing a muscular swing into the side of your skull
overpowering you with a violent swipe to the legs

overwhemlming you with no way to stop the excruciating pain, instead you are left to die, slowly
engulfing you, so you are unable to breethe
--drop/throw-------------------
throwing it towards the back of your head as you read this line
dropping it from a 20 story building onto your head, knocking you unconscious
placing it on your toes so they break
tossing it with ease through your window, so that hundreds of shards of glass fly at you and damage all exposed skin
--vehicles-------------------
tying you to the ground, and then watching it run you over
pushing you into its path, resulting it hundreds of broken bones as you whole body becomes crippled
driving straight for you, and slicing you in half
running you over, and then reversing to run you over again
